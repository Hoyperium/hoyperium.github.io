<p class="snappable do-snap">
This morning, I woke up at 11:30. I left my bed at 16:30. This means that five hours have gone missing.    
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Now I want to die.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I have been dealing with these mysterious cases of missing hours for years now. Sometimes as little as a single, even half an hour vanishes. Usually it is more.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Sometimes, the number reaches double digits. This happens more often than you’d think.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
The longer the missing span of time, the worse the effects. Tiredness. Self-disdain. A distinct feeling of complete and utter emptiness.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
For a long time, the primary theory involved me forgetting to eat.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I’ve started an alternative theory.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Are you ready?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I think these lost moments are encounters with divine infinity.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Think about it.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
The primary symptom is a loss of time. What is time? Time, it’s whatever is between the beginning and the end. That’s what time is. It’s precisely that space, or whatever, between tick and tock, between the Big Bang and the moment the athlete passes the finish line, between the first capital and the period. Between Alpha and Omega. That’s time.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Time is between. It needs a beginning, it needs and end. If something does not have those things, it is not time; it is something else. It is infinite, and it is divine.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
But it doesn’t make sense, does it?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Clearly, there’s a beginning and an end. They’re clearly marked, even – 11:30, 16:30. How does infinity fit in five hours? How has divinity snuck into my bedroom?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
But it does make sense, doesn’t it?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
We deal with arbitrary beginnings, endings and lacks thereof all the time. It’s what’s needed to create a story of any kind. 
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I’ve been paying attention to the NBA, lately. At some point in history, it was decided that a basketball game will end 48 minutes of playing time after it begins. This ending moment is completely arbitrary, of course – it might just as well have been 12, or 56, or 480 minutes – but it is important nonetheless. Having a predetermined ending allows there to be a game in the first place, allows a story to be told; without a predetermined ending, there can be no winner, and without a winner, there is no reason to play. And without a reason to play, there would be no beginning. The same game of meaning is played on a larger scale. A season is predetermined to last 82 games, followed by a number of play-off series. The winner of the play-off series is said to be the champion, the greatest team – and the fact that over the course of the season they were most likely defeated many times over no longer matters. This is how narratives are created.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
The thing is that I – that we – seem to be able to think only in terms of narratives and stories. We use stories for our existence the same way that mathematics uses numbers. It’s the fabric of the thing. It’s how we know things. How we make things real.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
But, then, it doesn’t make sense, does it?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
After all, don’t I want to live forever? Don’t we all?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
If something ends, <i>truly</i> ends, then what was the point? The result of a complete ending is a death, more than a death. It is silent, it is still. It is nothing; when all motion ceases, does matter even exist? Does anything exist? 
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Has anything ever existed?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I am not the only one who is worried about this, and I know that is the case because of the question just about every religion seems to give an answer to: “what happens after I die?”
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Because the simplest answer is, of course, nothing. Life ceases to exist, and the body it inhabited becomes dust. Life ends, and after that nothing happens ever again.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
And so, we say to ourselves, death is the end; but it is not The End. When you die, you end, but you also go to Hades, or Valhalla, or Heaven or Hell. Forever, divine infinity. Live in death, to no End.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
…
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I-
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Excuse me, to what end? 
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Is there no End, then, in the afterlife? But then-
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
There are two options, I suppose. Either existence after the end is meaningful, but then it must also, at some point, end. A human is reincarnated into another creature, the resting souls in Valhalla are called to arms during Ragnarök, and at the End of Times, Heaven and Earth collapse into one another to create a new city under God. Jannah is eternal, but filled with cycles of repetition; ends that are not Ends. Or, alternatively, there is no end after the end, meaning death is the true End, which is still and meaningless. A warrior that enters the Greek underworld will be spattered with blood for the rest of eternity. No future ending, no change, no meaning. Eternal nothingness, The End.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Hades provides a morbid death.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
And yet, we have Sisyphus.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Albert Camus’ famous parable, from the old Greek myth: in that Greek underworld of infinite stasis and meaninglessness, there is a king who is eternally doomed to roll a massive boulder up a hill. He may reach his goal; but as soon as he does, the darned rock rolls down the other side, and his task begins anew. Of this myth of eternal torture, the Frenchman simply says:
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
“One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Sisyphus’ work does not, in fact, have an Ending; but it has an end. The end is when the boulder rests on top of the mountain. He will never actually reach that end, that much is true; but there is, at the very least, a perception of an end. And so, there is a perception of a beginning. And so, there is time. And life. And, in some shape, meaning.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I have danced around the mystery of the missing hours for long enough – or perhaps, not at all.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
The truth is that I live in a world in which powerful entities hold a vested interest in my perception of time.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I should be more specific.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Companies want my time and attention, so that they can use their platforms to advertise to me, in order to make money off of my time.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
My limited life span.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Yours, too.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
So they appeal to you, and your greedy soul.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Your soul that wants to live forever.
</p><div class="snappable do-snap"><p class = "text-gradient">
They tell you, “Here is a window into the world! There is an endless stream of thoughts and opinions and entertainment and jokes and stories and art and writings and movies and music and people and cats and dogs and backflips and fails and genocide and snuff videos and personality quizzes and games and tips and tricks and love and hate and sex and sports and facts and podcasts and history and future and news and now and comedy and sexism and homophobia and racism and car races and politics and previews and woodworking and dating shows and tattoos and football and top-5-lists and TV-shows and conspiracies and more and more and more and more
</p></div><p class="snappable do-snap">
“There’s no end!”
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
“Eternal growth!”
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
“Are you in?”
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Are you in?
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
Just like that, with a magic trick, with smoke and mirrors, the end is no longer in sight.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
And with no end in sight, meaning starts to get blurry. 
</p><p id="almost" class="snappable do-snap">
And time ceases to exist.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
I believe I have solved this whodunnit.
</p><p class="snappable do-snap">
The ending is in sight.

<section id="ending" class="snappable do-snap">
<p >---</p>
<p>This article will end eighteen sentences after this one.</p>
<p>So, that is where those hours went; they were stolen from me by a corporation, and they took more than just my time. In order to commit the biggest time heist possible, they eroded my sense of an ending, but if there is no end, there is no meaning – the ending justifies the meaning, so to speak. That emptiness that I feel is an existential desire towards some semblance of meaning, and to that end, an ending. I spent five hours basking in divine, or infernal, or just numinous infinity; I have been robbed of my time, of meaning and of a piece of my soul; and now, I want to die.</p>
<p>It’s a neat little conclusion, one that allows me to redirect all of my self-disdain towards a big, faceless company and the system that encourages it. I can rest easy that Marx was right, capitalism is evil, and I’ve done nothing wrong. Society is bad, and as a result I want to die and there is nothing that I can do about it. Huzzah.</p>
<p>I resent it, that conclusion. I resent it, because I am now doing the same thing to myself, that I am accusing “the system” of. I am telling myself that there is nothing I can do, that there is no point, no end, no meaning. I am now being robbed of my time on Earth by nobody other than myself.</p>
<p>And so, I don’t accept it. There will be an end, and I’ll pick it myself. It does not matter whether I will ever actually reach it or not – Sisyphus certainly won’t, and must imagine him to be alright. There will be an end.</p>
<p>I see it now.</p>
<p>Here it comes!</p>
